When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	What if other people wanted work on it with you?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If it pulls at a random point in time in the middle of your code you might lose 	your work.
